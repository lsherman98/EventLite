### Introduction

EventLite is a clone of the Eventbrite website. The EventBrite platform is a marketplace and directory for a wide range of events all over the world. In this clone users can create accounts, buy tickets to events, create their own events, manage their purchases and keep a list of bookmarked events. They can browse events by time, location, category, and price as well as view events organized by specific users. While this clone doesnt have all the features of the original EventBrite website it has the core functionality while keeping the design and user expierecen as streamlined as possible. I took some creative liberties and added my own touch to the colors schemes, and layout of the website.
