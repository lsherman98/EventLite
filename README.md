#Welcome to EventLite

Check out the [Live Site](https://eventlite-q3yt.onrender.com/)!

### Introduction

EventLite is a clone of the Eventbrite website. The EventBrite platform is a marketplace and directory for a wide range of events all over the world. In this clone users can create accounts, buy tickets to events, create their own events, manage their purchases and keep a list of bookmarked events. They can browse events by time, location, category, and price as well as view events organized by specific users. While this clone doesnt have all the features of the original EventBrite website it has the core functionality while keeping the design and user expierecen as streamlined as possible. I took some creative liberties and added my own touch to the colors schemes, and layout of the website. 

Technologies implemented in this project include:
* Languages: Javascript, Ruby, Python, HTML, CSS
* Frontend: React-Redux
* Backend: Ruby on Rails
* Database: PostgreSQL
* Hosting: Render
* Assest Storage: AWS Simple Cloud Storage (S3)

Viewing and sorting events is as simple as choosing your desired filters and seeing the available events change.

Once logged in creating an event can be done whenever you like. Dont forget to upload a banner image or flyer for your event.
